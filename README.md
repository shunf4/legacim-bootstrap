legacim-bootstrap
===

legacim-bootstrap is the not-so-lightweight version of [legacim](https://github.com/shunf4/legacim), a frontend scaffold to build simple web pages (or web apps) that run even in IE6.

In legacy IE browsers of course not all features work, but pages will have basic readability and interoperability.

legacim-bootstrap is shipped with Bootstrap 2.3.2, which brings lots of UI features. But selectivizr2 is not imported in consideration of compatibility, so some CSS selectors are not usable.

### Features

- [Bootstrap 2.3.2](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/tree/v2.3.2)
- [bsie](https://github.com/ddouble/bsie), Some fixes (fixfix) added
- [html5shiv](https://github.com/aFarkas/html5shiv)
- [jQuery 1.12.4](https://releases.jquery.com/jquery/)
